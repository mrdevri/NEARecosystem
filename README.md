# NEAR Ecosystem

This repository is the data source for the NEAR Ecosystem page, located at [near.org/ecosystem](https://near.org/ecosystem).

# Contributing Guidelines

All integrations in the NEAR Ecosystem are composed of two files: a Markdown file with headers, and an .svg or .png image. To add a new project to the ecosystem page, create both a new Markdown file in the `projects` or `guilds` directory and add a new .svg or .png image in the `img` directory.
