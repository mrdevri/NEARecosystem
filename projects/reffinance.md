Ref Finance is a community-led, multi-purpose Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform built on NEAR Protocol. 
Ref combines several core components: a decentralized exchange, lending, a synthetic asset issuer, and more -— into a single, synchronous DeFi stack.

Ref will take full advantage of NEAR’s low fees ($0.005 per swap), one-to-two second finality, 
and WebAssembly-based runtime (hello, Rust smart contracts!) to rival even CEX costs and speeds 
and become a powerful addition to the increasingly multi-chain DeFi ecosystem.
